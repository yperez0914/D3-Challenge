# D3-Challenge
<br>
For this project, I used D3 to take in CSV data from 2014 US Census Bureau and created a scatterplot of lack of healthcare(%) vs. in poverty(%), by state. In order to do this, axes, scales, and circles were created and appended to an svg element on the page. A tooltip was created to provide detailed percentages for each state when it's respective circle is hovered over by the user. In order to run the page properly, please make sure you have access to the data.csv, app.js, and index.html files on the repo.
